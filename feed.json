However, I found out that shared hosting has too many restrictions such as you have no control over softwares, so I switched to VPS. I also deployed some instances in AWS for the course project when I'm studying in University of Missouri for master's. After graduation, I tried Heroku as well, for running small demo apps. Although I'm not expert in cloud computing, I had some experiences and knows something about it.",
